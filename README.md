#Website
ShopWhat is an e-commerce platform that functions similarly to Lazada and Shopee with a business model that sell goods on their platform.  It originated in Singapore and offers a wide range of items to customers, but for the time being we are concentrating on the "Sports" department. Through strong payment and logistical support, the website provides a easy, secure, and fast online shopping experience.
This website/project is done by:
Front-end developer: Neu You Sheng.
API developer: Kyan Foo Zhi Kai.

#Design Process
This website is specialized designed for everyone who intends to use high-quality sports products in Singapore. Users are able to buy various kinds of sports products at a reasonable price and enjoy fast logistic service online on this website. We understand that our users are required for a one-stop sporting website that allows them to look out for all kinds of sports products and enjoy discount events. This is our mission to help them to achieve this.
User stories example:
-As a student, I wish I could have high-quality sports shoes at affordable prices and enjoy doing my favourite sports to the fullest.
-As a working adult, I wish I could use the shortest possible time to buy my customize sports necessaries online.
With these user stories points, we come out with this wireframe design in Adobe XD: https://xd.adobe.com/view/19d4d0b0-dbcf-4a20-a964-5bb20d5b8047-4c87/
