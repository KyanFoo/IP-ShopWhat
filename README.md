#Design Process
This website is specialized designed for everyone who intends to use high-quality sports products in Singapore. Users are able to buy various kinds of sports products at a 
reasonable price and enjoy fast logistic service online on this website. We understand that our users are required for a one-stop sporting website that allows them to look 
out for all kinds of sports products and enjoy discount events. This is our mission to help them to achieve this.<br>
User stories example:<br>
-As a student, I wish I could have high-quality sports shoes at affordable prices and enjoy doing my favourite sports to the fullest.<br>
-As a working adult, I wish I could use the shortest possible time to buy my customize sports necessaries online. <br>
